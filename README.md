# Brainflix
This is a full stack react application project created for BrainStation software engineering boot camp using React, React-Router, Node.js, Express, and APIs.

This project was completed over a period of three weeks, with each week corresponding to a separate sprint.

- Sprint 1 focused on setting up the user interface (UI) of the site using Semantic HTML, BEM methodology, and responsive design.
- Sprint 2 allowed for the implementation of basic React fundamentals such as component lifecycle methods, using props and state as well as JSX.
- Sprint 3 involved the utilization of React-Router for declarative routing, creation of API endpoints in order to receive and return data, and the use of Axios to pull data from the API.

This repository contains the final product as it was submitted.

## Features
The project has the following features:

- Pulling video data from API using Axios
- Creating and displaying components using React
- Creating server using node.js and express
- Posting a video in upload page will automatically update the page with the new video.
